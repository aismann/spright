    <summary>spright is more than a simple sprite sheet packer</summary>
    <description>
An advanced sprite sheet packer and sprite annotator.

Its key ideas are:

- Keep all the information about the sprites and tiles, required for being efficiently consumable by the game engine, in a plain text file.
- Instead of forcing one to split each sprite in a separate file and later address them using the filename, it should be possible to keep them in whatever format they are most conveniently to handle.
- It should be possible to give each sprite an ID, group them (e.g. for animations) or further annotate them for game specific purposes.
- The tool should be able to deduce obvious information from the input images and assist with completing the required information.

While any text editor can be used for writing the input definition, the [Visual Studio Code Extension](https://github.com/houmain/spright-vscode) can greatly simplify the process.

Also have a look at the [spright test suite](https://github.com/houmain/spright-test-suite) to get an impression of the functionality.
